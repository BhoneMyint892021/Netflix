# Netflix
Final project 

In Netflix, defects such as video buffering, app crash on login, slow startup, and payment failure significantly impact both user experience and business performance. Video buffering and slow startup are performance defects that reduce streaming quality and cause user frustration due to delays and interruptions. App crash on login is a critical functional defect because it prevents users from accessing their accounts and core services. Payment failure is a serious defect affecting subscription processing and company revenue, potentially blocking user access. Overall, these issues highlight the importance of strong system performance, reliable functionality, and secure transaction processing to maintain customer satisfaction and service quality.
